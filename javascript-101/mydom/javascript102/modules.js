// Es6 Modules Why?

// 1.Load order does not matter.
// 2.Multiple items can load from a module, but only one instance of the module is created/needed.
// 3.You do not need to worry about global variables and namesapce issues any longer.
// 4.You can load only one file and the modules will handle the rest.
// 5.It follows patterns of many other languages.
// 6.It protects functions not allowing you to accidently overwrite a function.
// 7.React Does it this way. Might as well get started now.

// in html in the beginning, type = module
